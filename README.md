# 🧠 Xking Language

**Xking Language** is a self-built programming language created to understand how languages work internally — from reading code to executing it.

This is not a toy copied from a tutorial.  
This is a **learning-driven language project** focused on interpreters, parsing, and execution logic.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Project

Most developers *use* programming languages.  
Very few try to **build one**.

This project exists to:

- Understand how source code is interpreted
- Learn language design fundamentals
- Explore parsing, execution flow, and errors
- Prove low-level understanding beyond frameworks

---

## ⚙️ What Xking Language Does

✔ Reads custom language syntax  
✔ Parses statements step by step  
✔ Executes instructions using an interpreter  
✔ Keeps the codebase readable and extendable  

The goal is clarity, not complexity.

---

## 🛠 Core Components

Xking-language/ ├── lexer        # Breaks code into tokens ├── parser       # Converts tokens into logic ├── interpreter # Executes the program ├── examples     # Sample Xking programs └── main file    # Entry point

Each part exists for learning and extension.

---

## 🚀 Example (Concept)

```xk
print "Hello, Xking"
a = 10
b = 20
print a + b

Simple syntax. Clear intent.
Perfect for understanding execution flow.
```

🧩 Why This Project Matters

This project shows that I:

Understand how programming languages work internally

Can design systems, not just consume APIs

Can read and write low-level logic

Care about fundamentals, not just trends


Frameworks change.
Foundations don’t.


---

🧠 Skills Demonstrated

Interpreter design

Parsing logic

Language syntax design

Problem decomposition

Clean project structuring



---

🧪 Status

🟡 Actively evolving
New features like loops, functions, and error handling can be added incrementally.


---

📌 Who This Is For

Learners curious about compilers/interpreters

Developers who want to go deeper

Interviewers looking for real understanding, not buzzwords
